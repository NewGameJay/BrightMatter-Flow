## Test Flow Results

### ✅ 1. Campaign Creation
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "campaignId": "campaign-1761614486784"
}
```

### ✅ 2. Creator Joins
- Creator 1: `0xCreator1` - Joined successfully
- Creator 2: `0xCreator2` - Joined successfully

### ✅ 3. Content Submissions
| Creator | Posts | Platform | Resonance Score |
|---------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Creator 1 | 1 | Twitter | 100.0 |
| Creator 2 | 2 | YouTube, Twitter | 100.0 each |

### ✅ 4. Leaderboard Calculation
```json
{
  "leaderboard": [
    {
      "creatorAddr": "0xCreator2",
      "totalScore": 200,
      "submissionCount": 2,
      "percent": "66.67"
    },
    {
      "creatorAddr": "0xCreator1",
      "totalScore": 100,
      "submissionCount": 1,
      "percent": "33.33"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Calculation**:
- Creator 1: 100 resonance → 100/300 = 33.33%
- Creator 2: 200 resonance → 200/300 = 66.67%
- Total: 300 resonance points

### ✅ 5. Agent Verification & Payout
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "campaignId": "campaign-1761614486784",
  "action": "payout",
  "type": "open",
  "splits": [
    {
      "addr": "0xCreator1",
      "percent": 0.33333333,
      "amountFlow": "33.33333300"
    },
    {
      "addr": "0xCreator2",
      "percent": 0.66666667,
      "amountFlow": "66.66666700"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Payout Calculation**:
- Creator 1: 33.33% of 100 FLOW = 33.333333 FLOW
- Creator 2: 66.67% of 100 FLOW = 66.666667 FLOW
- Total: 100.0 FLOW (exact match)

### ✅ 6. Campaign Status Update
- Status changed from `pending` → `paid`
- Payout receipt stored with transaction ID: `mock-tx-1761614531570`
- Timestamp: `2025-10-28T01:22:11.570Z`

---

## Verification Checks

### ✅ Split Normalization
- Percents sum to 1.0 (0.33333333 + 0.66666667 = 1.0)
- Amounts sum to budget (33.333333 + 66.666667 = 100.0)
- 8 decimal place precision maintained

### ✅ Fraud Detection
- No duplicate post IDs detected
- All submissions within time window
- All metrics valid (no negative values)

### ✅ Database Integrity
- Campaign persisted correctly
- Participants tracked accurately
- Submissions stored with unique hashes
- Payout receipt recorded

### ✅ API Endpoints
All endpoints working as expected:
- `POST /api/campaigns` ✅
- `POST /api/campaigns/:id/join` ✅
- `POST /api/campaigns/:id/submit` ✅
- `GET /api/campaigns/:id/leaderboard` ✅
- `POST /api/agent/verify/:id` ✅
- `GET /api/campaigns/:id` ✅

## Edge Cases Tested

1. **Multiple submissions per creator**: Creator 2 submitted 2 posts → scores aggregated correctly
2. **Proportional splits**: Uneven resonance scores → correct percentage calculation
3. **Budget distribution**: 100 FLOW split into exact amounts with no remainder

---

## Production Readiness

### ✅ Backend Services
- Split calculations working correctly
- Database operations functional
- Fraud detection active
- API endpoints stable

### ✅ Forte Integration
- Agent verification logic correct
- Split normalization for UFix64
- Payout calculation accurate
- Receipt storage working

### ⏳ Pending for Full Production
- Deploy updated Cadence Actions to mainnet
- Connect to actual Forte Actions chain
- Test with real FLOW transactions
- Frontend UI components
- Wallet integration
