## ✅ Verification Tests

### Test 1: Health Check
```bash
curl https://brightmatter-oracle.fly.dev/health
```
**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "service": "brightmatter-oracle-forte",
  "network": "mainnet",
  "contracts": {
    "CampaignEscrowV3": "0x14aca78d100d2001",
    "CreatorProfileV2": "0x14aca78d100d2001"
  },
  "forte": {
    "enabled": true,
    "features": ["scheduled-transactions", "agents", "actions"]
  }
}
```

### Test 2: Mock Post Analysis
```bash
curl -X POST https://brightmatter-oracle.fly.dev/api/analyze-post \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://x.com/test/status/123"}'
```
**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "score": "96.8",
  "metrics": {

## 🚀 Next Steps for E2E Testing

1. **Create Test Campaign** via frontend or API
2. **Submit Creator Posts** with mock URLs
3. **Wait for Agent** (or manually trigger via API)
4. **Verify Payout** occurs automatically
5. **Document Results** for hackathon submission

---

## 📝 Demo Flow

```
1. Brand creates campaign (6h deadline)
   ↓
2. Oracle schedules Forte Agent (+1h after deadline)
   ↓
3. Creator submits post → Oracle records proof on-chain
   ↓
4. Deadline passes → Forte triggers Agent automatically
   ↓
5. Agent verifies proofs → Runs fraud checks
   ↓
6. If clean: Action chain executes
   - WithdrawVault → SplitFundsByScore → DepositToCreators
   ↓
7. Creators receive FLOW automatically
```

- ✅ Oracle-only functions (addProof, updateScore, payout/refund)
- ✅ Fraud detection (duplicate checks, engagement ratios)
- ✅ Idempotent payouts (prevents double-spending)
- ✅ Status guards (PAID/REFUNDED states)
